    "## How HealthBot Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Topic Selection**: Patient enters a health topic they want to learn about\n",
    "2. **Information Gathering**: HealthBot searches trusted medical sources using Tavily\n",
    "3. **Summarization**: AI creates patient-friendly explanations from medical sources\n",
    "4. **Education**: Patient reads the comprehensive health information\n",
    "5. **Assessment**: HealthBot generates a comprehension quiz question\n",
    "6. **Feedback**: AI evaluates the answer and provides educational feedback\n",
    "7. **Continuation**: Option to learn about another topic or exit\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trusted Medical Sources:\n",
    "- Mayo Clinic (mayoclinic.org)\n",
    "- National Institutes of Health (nih.gov)\n",
    "- Centers for Disease Control (cdc.gov)\n",
    "- WebMD (webmd.com)\n",
    "- Healthline (healthline.com)\n",
    "- MedlinePlus (medlineplus.gov)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Privacy & Safety:\n",
    "- No personal health information is stored\n",
    "- Session data is reset between topics\n",
    "- Information is for educational purposes only\n",
    "- Always consult healthcare professionals for medical decisions"
